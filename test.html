        <p>This is my cool website rendered in my browser engine. It is very rudimentary but taught me alot about how browsers render content on pages.</p>
        <p>I began by following a tutorial by Matt Brubeck called "Let's build a browser engine". This tutorial takes you up to the point of being able to render divs, however did not cover inline rendering or text rendering. I had to come up with these myself you might notice a drop in quality at those points lol
        </p>
        <p>This was my first sizable project with C++, I think I ended up coding in a "Java" like way. I should spend sometime reading about some best practices. C++ was enjoyable however and I think I'll use it again in future.</p>
